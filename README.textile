h1. jonpearse.net (v2.1)

This repo will be the code that powers my website ( "jonpearse.net":https://jonpearse.net ). 

I say ‘will be’ as the current live version (from May 2018) contains a lot of semi-proprietary code that was used for the sake of expediency, but that cannot be open-sourced.
This is a ground-up rewrite that will retain much of the same functionality (+ some improvements) just without any IP issues. I might even get some blog posts out of it, who knows? =)

Source code for the previous version of the site (2013–2018) can be found in "its own repo":https://github.com/jonpearse/jonpearse.net-2013.
